# TNR
Tensor Network Renormalisation

This contains some MATLAB scripts to perform the Tensor Network Renormalisation (TNR) algorithm. This is for a "Quantum Coffee" talk given at MPQ on the 17/03/2016. The algorithm was introduced by G. Evenbly and G. Vidal in the paper

but the code is based on:

G. Evenbly,	arXiv:1509.07484

Additional functions required to run the scripts here are:

ncon: R. N. C. Pfeifer, G. Evenbly, S. Singh, G. Vidal, arXiv:1402.0939.

netcon: R. N. C. Pfeifer, J. Haegeman, F. Verstraete, arXiv:1304.6112.
http://arxiv.org/abs/1304.6112

Both of which can be downloaded by selecting "other formats" and "download source" on arXiv.

Please note that this code is meant for illustrative purposes only and there is also a bug in it somewhere.
